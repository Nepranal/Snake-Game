This group project is for the course **ENGG1340 - Computer Progamming II** at The University of Hong Kong (HKU).

The project implements the Snake Game in C++ with some extra features. This game was tested under HKU CS's server: academy11.cs.hku.hk

# Game Description

- Player would be playing as a snake entity enclosed in an $25 \times 25$ space

- ♣ represents the snake food in which when the snake eats it, the snake will increase in size.

- The snake can travel through the boundary of the $N \times N$ space passing through the # and come out of the other side within the space.

- The game has 3 modes: Easy, Medium, and Hard.

  - Medium would have obstacles, labeled ☒, inside the N x N space.

  - Hard would have obstacles, poisonous food represented as ♦, and heart food represented as ♥.

# Project Requirements

1. **RNG element**: food and posions spawn randomly

2. **Data structures to store game state**: arrays

3. **Dynamic memory management**: Snake is a vector which is ammended as the game is played.

4. **Input/output**: User has to direct the snake itself

5. The game will be saved in the files, so users can resume the game. High Scores will be stored in the files with the player's name.

When the game is over, a message will be printed on screen.

# Objectives

survive as long as you can while evading to eat yourself, hit barrier, or eating poison. In Hard Mode, you need to eat food or other fruit/heart in a way that there are less poisions on the board and the board remains mostly clear so you can move snake easily.

Try to eat food by reaching it by shortest distance possible so less poisons are on the board. You can move the snake with the W A S D keys.

# Features

- Food with different symbol that will increase the score in hard mode.
- Poison with different symbol that will kill the snake. (Poison is symbolized with the diamond symbols)
- Barriers with different symbol. If you touch barrier, you will die.
- You can move around the board.
- Your Highscores will be saved (input x) and you can store many games and resume it again.
